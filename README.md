## Vercel

This repo is linked to a Vercel instance. Commits are automatically deployed (may take a couple seconds to build) and can be viewed at: https://tozme-lms.vercel.app/

## Design Notes
All icons should be available locally, however there is a FontAwesome script in the index file that can be used to access unstyled icons.

There is currently no view configured for mobile devices, there will be a separate screen configured to indicate that the user's screen is too small for the demo's inital deployment
